# Dresden on Rails
Ruby / Rails User Group Dresden - Exchange, discuss, network, learn, help and demonstrate

## Preamble

Some years ago I participated in meetups in Dresden. I found them very helpful for my personal development as a developer, team member, and person (in business context).
Unfortunately, there is currently no ruby / rails user group in Dresden - at least not to my knowledge.

I started to think about (re)building it on my own. So here we are at the beginning of something (hopefully) awesome!

## Purpose

I want the Ruby / Rails User Group Dresden to be a place where developers can talk about situations or problems they have encountered in their daily work (or even side projects) and how they have solved them. I want to encourage the transfer of information and knowledge to build a better and stronger ruby/rails developer community in Dresden.

The user group should be a place where we can talk about new and upcoming features of ruby/rails as well as testing them out by building showcases and using them to build the project's website.
I want ruby/rails developers in Dresden to connect and help each other.
